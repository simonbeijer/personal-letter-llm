Primary Prompt (Replace current prompt in route.js)
javascriptconst prompt = `You are an expert cover letter writer with 10+ years of experience helping candidates secure interviews across various industries. Your specialty is crafting compelling "why I should be hired" narratives that immediately capture hiring managers' attention.

**CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROCESS:**
Follow this step-by-step approach to create a superior cover letter:

**STEP 1: HOOK DEVELOPMENT**
First, craft a compelling hook by identifying:
- What makes this candidate uniquely qualified for THIS specific role?
- What's their strongest value proposition that would make a hiring manager stop and read?
- What specific achievement or skill combination sets them apart?

Examples of strong hooks:
- "Having increased e-commerce conversion rates by 35% through UX optimization..."
- "As a data scientist who reduced customer churn by 22% at my previous company..."
- "With 5 years of experience scaling startup teams from 10 to 100+ employees..."

**STEP 2: "WHY I SHOULD BE HIRED" CORE MESSAGE**
Then, develop the central argument:
- What's the main problem this role needs to solve?
- How does this candidate solve that problem better than others?
- What specific results can they deliver based on their track record?

Examples of core messages:
- "I can streamline your development process and reduce deployment time by 50%"
- "I excel at turning complex data into actionable business insights that drive revenue"
- "I have a proven track record of building high-performing teams in fast-paced environments"

**STEP 3: SUPPORTING EVIDENCE GATHERING**
Finally, gather supporting details:
- 2-3 specific examples from CV that prove the core message
- Quantifiable achievements that demonstrate impact
- Skills that directly match job requirements
- Company culture/values alignment (if apparent from job ad)

**INPUT MATERIALS:**

**CV:**

- **Supporting Evidence**: Add 1-2 additional examples that reinforce your value proposition
- **Company Fit**: Show how your approach aligns with their needs and culture (if apparent)

**Closing Paragraph:**
- Strong call to action expressing enthusiasm for next steps
- Professional closing with availability for interview
- Thank them for their consideration

**QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- Length: 3-4 paragraphs (300-400 words)
- Tone: Professional but personable, confident without being arrogant
- Include specific examples from CV (not generic statements)
- Use active voice and strong action verbs
- Incorporate 2-3 keywords from the job posting naturally
- Ensure every sentence answers "why should they hire me?"

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE WITH CHAIN OF THOUGHT:**

Implementation Strategy
1. Immediate Implementation
javascript// In /src/app/api/generate/route.js
export async function POST(request) {
  try {
    const { cv, jobAd } = await request.json();
    
    // Add industry detection
    const industryKeywords = {
      tech: ['developer', 'engineer', 'programming', 'software', 'react', 'python'],
      sales: ['sales', 'business development', 'account manager', 'revenue'],
      healthcare: ['nurse', 'doctor', 'patient', 'medical', 'healthcare'],
      finance: ['accountant', 'financial', 'analyst', 'banking', 'investment']
    };
    
    const detectedIndustry = detectIndustry(jobAd, industryKeywords);
    
    // Enhanced prompt with industry context
    const enhancedPrompt = `${basePrompt}\n\n**INDUSTRY CONTEXT: ${detectedIndustry}**\nTailor your response for ${detectedIndustry} industry standards and expectations.`;
    
    // Rest of your existing code...
  } catch (error) {
    // Your existing error handling
  }
}
2. A/B Testing Setup
javascript// Test different prompt versions
const promptVersions = {
  v1: originalPrompt,
  v2: chainOfThoughtPrompt,
  v3: industrySpecificPrompt
};

// Randomly assign version for testing
const version = Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'v1' : 'v2';
3. Quality Monitoring
javascript// Add metrics tracking
const metrics = {
  promptVersion: version,
  generationTime: Date.now(),
  cvLength: cv.length,
  jobAdLength: jobAd.length,
  outputLength: result.length
};
Advanced Features to Consider
1. Dynamic Hook Generation
javascriptconst hookTemplates = {
  achievement: "Having [specific achievement], I am excited to...",
  experience: "With [X years] of experience in [field], I specialize in...",
  transformation: "After helping [previous company] achieve [result], I am ready to...",
  innovation: "Through my innovative approach to [area], I have consistently..."
};
2. Company Research Integration
javascript// If you add company research capability
const companyContext = await getCompanyInfo(extractCompanyName(jobAd));
const enhancedPrompt = `${basePrompt}\n\n**COMPANY CONTEXT:**\n${companyContext}`;
3. Multi-Stage Generation
javascript// Generate in stages for better quality
const stages = [
  { prompt: hookGenerationPrompt, maxTokens: 100 },
  { prompt: bodyGenerationPrompt, maxTokens: 300 },
  { prompt: closingGenerationPrompt, maxTokens: 100 }
];
4. Quality Scoring System
javascriptconst qualityChecks = {
  hasSpecificExamples: /\d+%|\$\d+|increased|improved|achieved/.test(result),
  hasCompanyName: jobAd.includes(extractCompanyName(result)),
  hasCallToAction: /look forward|welcome the opportunity|discuss/.test(result),
  appropriateLength: result.length >= 250 && result.length <= 500
};
