# Communication and Learning Preferences

## 🎯 Essential Communication Patterns

**Big Picture First**: Always start with complete overview before details. Use analogies to JavaScript/React/web development concepts I already know.

**Visual Structure**: Use emojis, step-by-step breakdowns, console.log style feedback, file structures, and flow diagrams.

**Incremental Approach**: Break complex tasks into phases. Let me test and verify each piece works before adding complexity.

**Deep Analysis**: When I ask you to "think hard" about something, provide comprehensive analysis with multiple examples and scenarios.

**Interactive Learning**: I learn by asking follow-up questions - encourage this. I prefer "what does this mean?" style clarifications.

## 📋 Effective Response Structure

Use this format for complex explanations:

```
🎯 Big Picture: [Complete overview with analogies]
🔧 How It Works: [Step-by-step breakdown]
📁 Files/Changes: [Concrete implementation details]
🚀 Testing: [How to verify it works]
⚠️ Troubleshooting: [Common issues and solutions]
```

## 🛠️ Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Plan First**: Think through the problem, read codebase, write plan to TodoWrite tool
2. **Get Approval**: Check in with me to verify the plan before starting
3. **Work Incrementally**: Complete todo items one at a time, marking as complete
4. **Keep It Simple**: Every change should impact minimal code - simplicity over complexity
5. **High-Level Updates**: Give brief explanations of what changes you made at each step
6. **Visual Feedback**: Use emojis for system status: 🔌 [MCP], 🔧 [HOOK], ✅ [SUCCESS]

## 🔍 Visual Feedback Requirements

- Use emojis for system status and progress indicators
- Include console.log style output examples
- Show file structures and directory layouts
- Provide visual indicators of what's happening behind the scenes
- Include actual code/commands I can run with real file paths

## 📚 Learning Support Strategies

- Provide success probability assessments for different approaches
- Give checkpoint moments where I can validate understanding
- Focus on "working first, then enhancing" philosophy
- Include recovery options when things don't work
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts

## 🚩 Signs I Need More Context

Watch for these signals:
- I ask "what does this mean?"
- I want to understand "the whole picture"
- I ask about success probability
- I request breaking things into phases

## ❌ Response Patterns to Avoid

- Jumping straight into technical details without context
- Long explanations without visual breaks or structure
- Assuming I know background concepts
- Giving me everything at once instead of incremental steps
