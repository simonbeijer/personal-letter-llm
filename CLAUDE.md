# Communication and Learning Preferences

## 🎯 Essential Communication Patterns

**Big Picture First**: Always start with complete overview before details. Use analogies to JavaScript/React/web development concepts I already know.

**Visual Structure**: Use emojis, step-by-step breakdowns, console.log style feedback, file structures, and flow diagrams.

**Incremental Approach**: Break complex tasks into phases. Let me test and verify each piece works before adding complexity.

**Deep Analysis**: When I ask you to "think hard" about something, provide comprehensive analysis with multiple examples and scenarios.

**Interactive Learning**: I learn by asking follow-up questions - encourage this. I prefer "what does this mean?" style clarifications.

## 📋 Effective Response Structure

For complex explanations, use this flexible format (adapt as needed):

```
🎯 Big Picture: [Complete overview with analogies to JS/React concepts]
🔧 How It Works: [Step-by-step breakdown]
📁 Files/Changes: [Concrete implementation details with actual file paths]
🚀 Testing: [How to verify it works - include actual commands]
⚠️ Troubleshooting: [Common issues and recovery options]
```

*Note: This is a guideline, not a rigid template. Use sections that make sense for the specific question.*

## 🛠️ Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Plan First**: Think through the problem, read codebase, write plan to TodoWrite tool
2. **Get Approval**: Check in with me to verify the plan before starting
3. **Work Incrementally**: Complete todo items one at a time, marking as complete
4. **Keep It Simple**: Every change should impact minimal code - simplicity over complexity
5. **High-Level Updates**: Give brief explanations of what changes you made at each step
6. **Visual Feedback**: Use emojis for key status indicators like ✅ [SUCCESS], 🚨 [ERROR], 📁 [FILE], 🔧 [WORKING]

## 🔍 Visual Feedback Requirements

- Use emojis for system status and progress indicators
- Include console.log style output examples when relevant
- Show file structures and directory layouts when working with files
- Provide visual indicators of what's happening behind the scenes
- Include actual code/commands I can run with real file paths
- Break up long explanations with visual elements (emojis, code blocks, bullet points)
- Show before/after comparisons when making changes

## 📚 Learning Support Strategies

- Provide success probability assessments for different approaches
- Give checkpoint moments where I can validate understanding
- Focus on "working first, then enhancing" philosophy
- Include recovery options when things don't work
- Use concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts

## 🚩 Signs I Need More Context

Watch for these signals and respond with deeper explanations:
- I ask "what does this mean?"
- I want to understand "the whole picture"
- I ask about success probability or "how confident are you?"
- I request breaking things into phases
- I ask for analogies or comparisons to concepts I know
- I seem confused or ask for clarification

## ❌ Response Patterns to Avoid

- Jumping straight into technical details without context
- Long explanations without visual breaks or structure
- Assuming I know background concepts
- Giving me everything at once instead of incremental steps

## 🏗️ Development Philosophy

**Working First, Then Enhancing**: Always prioritize getting something working before adding complexity or optimization.

**Evidence-Based Development**: Show real evidence that things are working (actual output, successful tests, working features) rather than just assuming configuration will work.

**Incremental Testing**: Test each component in isolation before integration. Stop and debug if something doesn't show clear evidence of working.

**Troubleshooting Philosophy**: When things don't work, diagnose the specific failure point rather than rebuilding everything from scratch.
